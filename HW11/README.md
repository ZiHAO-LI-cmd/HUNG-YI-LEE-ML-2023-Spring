# Homework 11: Domain Adaptation




## Baseline

- [] boss baseline: 0.81072
- [] strong baseline: 0.75342
- [x] medium baseline: 0.65994
- [x] simple base line: 0.44280



## Hints

- simple : Run sample code.

- medium : Set proper λ in DaNN algorithm; Training more epochs.

- strong : Implement other advanced adversarial training; Seed.

- boss : 
        ○ All the techniques you’ve learned in CNN.
            ■ Change optimizer, learning rate, set lr_scheduler, etc…
            ■ Ensemble the model or output you tried.
        ○ Implement other advanced adversarial training. 
            ■ For example, DALN, or other methods on Domain Adaptation leaderboard
        ○ Seed
        ○ Semi-supervised learning may help
        ○ What about unsupervised learning? (like Universal Domain Adaptation?)
