# Homework 5: Machine Translation

## Objectives:

- Train a simple RNN seq2seq to acheive translation
- Switch to transformer model to boost performance
- Apply Back-translation to furthur boost performance



## Baseline

- [x] boss baseline: 30.08
- [x] strong baseline: 23.57 
- [x] medium baseline: 18.44 
- [x] simple base line: 15.05



## Hints

- Simple Baseline: Train a simple RNN seq2seq to acheive translation
- Medium Baseline: Add learning rate scheduler and train longer
- Strong Baseline: Switch to Transformer and tuning hyperparameter
- Boss Baseline: Apply back-translation
