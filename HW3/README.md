# Homework 3: Image Classification

## Objectives:

- Solve image classification with convolutional neural networks(CNN).



## Baseline

- [ ] boss baseline: 0.874
- [ ] strong baseline: 0.814
- [ ] medium baseline: 0.700
- [ ] simple base line: 0.637



## Hints

- simple : Run Sample Code

- medium : Do some Data Augmentation & Train longer

- strong : Use predefined CNN from torchvision or TensorFlow 

- boss : Cross Validation + Ensemble or any other methods you know
